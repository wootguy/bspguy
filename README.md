# bspguy
A tool for modifying and merging Sven Co-op maps without decompiling.

# Usage
To launch the 3D editor, drag and drop a .bsp file onto the executable, or "Open with" bspguy, or run `bspguy <mapname>`

See the [wiki](https://github.com/wootguy/bspguy/wiki) for tutorials.

## Editor Features
- Keyvalue editor with FGD support
- Entity + BSP model creation and duplication
- Easy object movement and scaling
- Vertex manipulation + face splitting
    - Used to make perfectly shaped triggers. A box is often good enough, though.
- BSP model origin movement/alignment
- Optimize + clean commands to prevent overflows
- Hull deletion + redirection + creation
  - clipnode generation is similar to `-cliptype legacy` in the CSG compiler (the _worst_ method)
- Basic face editing

**The editor is full of bugs, unstable, and has no undo button yet. Save early and often! Make backups before experimenting with anything.**

Requires OpenGL 3.0 or later.

## First-time Setup
1. Click `File` -> `Settings` -> `General`
1. Set the `Game Directory` to your `Sven Co-op` folder path, then click `Apply Changes`.
    - This will fix the missing textures.
1. Click the `FGDs` tab and add the full path to your sven-coop.fgd (found in `Sven Co-op/svencoop/`). Click `Apply Changes`.
    - This will give point entities more colorful cubes, and enable the `Attributes` tab in the `Keyvalue editor`.

bspguy saves configuration files to `%APPDATA%/bspguy` on Windows.


## Command Line
Some functions are only available via the CLI.

```
Usage: bspguy <command> <mapname> [options]

<Commands>
  info      : Show BSP data summary
  merge     : Merges two or more maps together
  noclip    : Delete some clipnodes/nodes from the BSP
  delete    : Delete BSP models
  simplify  : Simplify BSP models
  transform : Apply 3D transformations to the BSP

Run 'bspguy <command> help' to read about a specific command.
```
